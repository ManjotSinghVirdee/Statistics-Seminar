# Notes to self
This folder is to collect and develop a basic linear model tutorial. 
There are numerous points that are releven to biological data that I may be unable to cover
such as:
- multicollinearity

I can explain the function lm and how to use it in conjunction with plotting
how to get p-values and correlation coefficients from it
how to write more complex models such as parabolic or logarithmic models
fitted values and residuals



AIC, BIC, Lars - LASSO - glmnet are beyond this scope
