* History of R
- What is R? R is a statistical coding language develeoped by statisticians for statisticians
- Why is this significant? This makes it much easier to read and write R.
It is laid out in a manner that easily goes from planning out a workflow to executing specific statistical methods.
- Merits of R
Large library of bioinformatic tools
Unfortunately this also tends to mean that many people get stuck on a sharp learning curve to even begin operating in R


** Why Code in R?
1. Building a reliable pipeline
2. Executing rigirous statistical methods on moderate to large data
3. Building beautiful visualizations

*** How to master R
To master R is not to become an expert. 
You simply need to be in control when you are navigating the landscape of R packages and manipulating/transforming/normalizing your particular dataset.

Lets now take a moment to talke with your neighbors. Where are you in your understanding of R? Do you feel like you have some level of mastery over the R language?
Or does it have mastery over you? Are you required to use R by some journal or academic field? Or is R your only way to access certain methods for your analysis?

This is still a coding language an there is some mental transformation when we want to convert an idea we have into code - Using Psudocode
